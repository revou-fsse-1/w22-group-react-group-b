### Background of the App

“Recipes come from the idea of a person with a several years of experience in the hospitality industry who shares their cooking knowledge. It begin from friends that gradually asking what’s the best recipe for some of the cuisine that they want to cook, then it turns like a habit. And recipes is here to make it easier for people who probably facing the same moments, then they can have a directly access to recipes. The result is a food recipe blog where users can share their recipes and access others' recipes.”
